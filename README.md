# ISL_Gesture_Recognition
This repository consists of video clips of selective gestures of Indian Sign Language (ISL), referring to National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) - India. These gestures were used to build a Wi-Fi CSI dataset, for estimating the gesture recognition accuracy using a Machine Learning approach. 

The complete set of ISL gestures by NIOS, India can be found under a playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUuOqp8QaNB0IG-GOV8wzKFsjL7v3iLIG

The ISL dataset is built by accuquiring the Channel State Information(CSI) of Wi-Fi signals using 802.11n Linux CSI tool(https://github.com/dhalperi/linux-80211n-csitool/).

This dataset is being used in a publication under review. Upon successful publication acceptance, the ISL dataset (both static and dynamic) will be made available here.
