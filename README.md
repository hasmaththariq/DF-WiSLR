# ISL_Gesture_Recognition
This repository consists of video clips of selective gestures of Indian Sign Language (ISL), referring to National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) - India. These gestures were used to build a Wi-Fi CSI dataset, for estimating the gesture recognition accuracy using a Machine Learning approach. 

The complete set of ISL gestures by NIOS, India can be found under a playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUuOqp8QaNB0IG-GOV8wzKFsjL7v3iLIG

The Wi-Fi CSI sign language dataset for the selective ISL gestures listed here was developed. Three volunteers performed the gestures in three different environments (2 home and 1 office). The ISL dataset developed comprises of 30 static gestures and 19 dynamic gestures looked over the huge database of NIOS. The raw CSI signal collected for 49 ISL gestures with three volunteers performing the signs in three different environments with 20 instances per sign gesture. 

Data acquisitions of static gestures are initiated after the volunteers are ready with the sign pose to ensure that no additional movement is recorded while capturing every instance. In contrast, the sign poses (upper body or hand movements) were repeated for the entire duration of data acquisition while collecting every dynamic instance. Static gestures The static sign gestures are highly fine-grained than the dynamic sign gestures, as some of the static signs will have a nearly similar orientation of head, arm and fingers.

This dataset is being used in a publication under review. Upon successful publication acceptance, the ISL dataset (both static and dynamic) will be made available here.
